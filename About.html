				<h1>How to play</h1>
				<p>The game itself has a good guide on how to get started, but I'll give a brief beginners guide here and then move on to some tips that I think will help anyone to play better.</p>
				<p>Gwent is a card game played between two people, each game is a best of three rounds, and to win a round you must finish with a higher point total then your opponent. There are four different groups you can play as, they are The Northern Realms, Monsters, Skellige and Scoia'tael. Each faction has their own unique cards, and their own strengths and weaknesses, there are also neutral cards that can play for any of the four factions.</p>
				<p>There are different types of cards, the first different types, are unit cards, and spell cards. Spell cards are for the most part, buff and debuff cards for units, while unit cards are the backbone of any deck and are played on the board. There are four different kind of unit cards, melee units, ranged units and siege units and agile units. Every card has a quality rating, bronze, silver and gold. You can have a maximum of 4 gold cards per deck, 6 silver cards and the rest bronze. Each deck can have between 25 and 40 cards.</p>
				<p>Your playing field, or board, is made up of two sides, yours and your opponents. Each side has three rows, a melee row, a ranged row and a siege row. Each row is for their respective units, except for agile unites who can go on any row, eg. a melee unit can only be placed on your melee row, while an agile unit can be placed on melee, ranged or siege row.</p>
				
				<h2 id="headTips">Tips</h2>
				<p>I'll give some tips based on how I play, they mostly won't be useful unless you have a grasp on how the game works. I've played almost exclusively as the Scoia'tael faction, so some of the tips will only really relate to them.</p>
				<ul id="aboutTips">
					<li>You're allowed between 25-40 cards per deck, I advise being as close to 25 as possible, as you want the best chances of drawing your best cards.</li>
					<li>As Scoia'tael, save your faction ability for the round after you you win a round, and then make your opponent go first, this will effectively waste one of their cards.</li>
					<li>Always try your best to stay a maximum of only one turn behind your opponents points, so that if they end their turn, you can overtake them with 1 card.</li>
					<li>Try not to put all of your eggs in one basket, it makes a very easy target. Play your units on different rows, and buff different units.</li>
					<li>As Scoia'tael, if playing with Francesca, try to save your ability until the last round, when you have the least amount of cards in your deck, so that you have the best chance of getting what you want/need.</li>
					<li>When choosing which three cards to switch at the beginning, prioritise a variety, get rid of First Lights, depending on preference, keep one or none of Mardroeme, and try to have only 1 of each bronze unit. Prioritise in that order. Similar for other decks.</li>
					<li>Use your Mardroemes wisely, the Spores half is usually more useful. You want to use it on cards that your opponent wants to revive, so they are particularily useful against Northern Realms and Skellige.</li>
					<li>Save your big plays when you can, if you have a weather card that using will put you in the lead for the round, don't use it thoughtlessly, save it for when they think they're far enough ahead to pass.</li>
					<li>A huge part of winning is knowing your cards, and the cards your opponent likely has. If you know your cards, you can try and keep track of them, and make more informed decisions about the odds of drawing the cards you want. When you know what cards your opponent is likely to have, you can try to predict their moves and reactions.</li>
					<li>Losing a round is usually better then going two or more cards down</li>
					<li>If the first round is lost, try and make sure that during the next round, you stay as close as possible to their score, preferably above after every one of your turns, or else you may have to play two or more cards after he has passed.</li>
					<li>A good tactic for when you've won the first round, is to keep playing as long as you can win with the cards you've played and still have in your hand against the cards they have played. This is especially good against an opponent where you're sure they have a card you don't want them to have in the final round, such as Northern Realms with Shani, so you try and force them to play it in round 2.</li>
					<li>Don't under estimate card advantage. I think it's often the most important thing in winning a game. Playing the last card in a game can be extremely powerful, as your opponent has no chance to counter.</li>
